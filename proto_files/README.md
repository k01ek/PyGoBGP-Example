# gRPC files

This files here are not needed as PyGoBGP handles the gRPC calls, however I decieded to keep gobgp gRPC file and populated python files for stub for reference.  `gobgp.proto` defines the gRPC API and other python files are populated from `gobgp.proto` file. 

Note that `gobgp.proto` file is from `gobgp` v1.25
